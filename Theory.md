- Data Structures is the way to arrange data in main memory for efficient usage. Eg. Linked List, Array, Stack, Queue.
- Algorithms are the sequence of steps to solve a specific problem
- Data Structures are the building blocks of any software program
- Data Structures facilitates storage, organisation, access and manipulation of data
- Data Structures can be categorised into two types: Linear Data Structures and Non-Linear Data Structure
  |Linear Data Structure|Non-Linear Data Structure|
  |---------------------|-------------------------|
  |Adajacently Attatched|Hierarchically attatched|
  |Single Level|Multi Level|
  |Easy|Difficult|
  |Single Run|Multiple Run|
  |Memory not utilised in efficient way|Memory utilised in efficient way|
  |Arrays, Stack, Linked List|Tree, Graph|
|Data Structure|Python|Java|C++|
|--------------|------|----|---|
|Array|List|Native Array and ArrayList|Native Array and std::vector|
|Hash Table|Dictionary|Hash Map and Linked Hash Map|std::map|
|Linked List|Not available|Linked List|std::list|
